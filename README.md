# Desig Shard

Your data will be decentralized into 3 database shardings namely `goku`, `gohan`, and `goten`. By this approach, the data is highly secure and avaiable.

# [IMPORTANT] The rule of upgrade

- Never upgrade all the server at the same version.
- Upgrade priority: `goku` -> `gohan` -> `goten`
